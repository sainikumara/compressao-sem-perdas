# Week 3

## What happened during week 3
- Fixing jacoco
- Reading more about Deflate
- Reading about bit operations
- Implementing IO, now data is read from files and written into files
- More testing and some refactoring

## What I learned
- I learned about reading from and writing to files; it can be surprisingly tricky
- Started learning about bit operations

## Questions
- JavaDoc still fails on my computer, error message says that The environment variable JAVA_HOME is not correctly set. I will keep looking into this.
- My compression rate is negative on file level, because of sub-optimal byte use. I might find a way to optimize that.

## Next
- Bit operations and file size optimization
- Getting JavaDoc to work
- Looking into Huffman coding
