# Project Specifications

This project aims to implement the lossless data compression algorithm [Deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFLATE) by first implementing [Lempel-Ziv (LZ77)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78) and combining it with [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

The resulting program will take a string file as input and give a compressed version of the file as output. It can also reverse the compression.
