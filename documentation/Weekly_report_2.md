# Week 2

## What happened during week 2
- Changing from Gradle to Maven
- Reading A LOT, trying to gain basic understanding of LZ77 and its implementations
- Creating first version of LZ77 compression and decompression implementation
- Creating first unit tests for LZ77 implementation
- Trying to get project files to work as intended (testing, checkstyle, etc)

## What I learned
- Gained a better understanding of different kinds of Lempel-Ziv algorithms and specifically LZ77

## Questions
- Should I try to go on bit level instead of just working with strings?
- The implementation could certainly be improved a lot, that requires more reading and better understanding
- Why does the JavaDoc creation keep failing?

## Next
- Improving and refactoring LZ77 implementation
- Getting JavaDoc to work
- Looking into Huffman coding
