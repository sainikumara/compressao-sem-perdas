# Week 1

## What happened during week 1
- Finding a topic
- Reading about the topic
- Creating the project and the initial documentation

## What I learned
- Basics of compression algorithms
- Basic ideas of Lempel-Ziv and Huffman algorithms
- How to create a Gradle project (I have only used Maven before)

## Questions
- For now the practical implementation of the LZ77 algorithm seems hard because of the very general level of documentations I have found. I will look deeper into this question next week.
- I have a very vague understanding of what kind of a structure the project will take.

## Next
- Planning the project structure
- Finding out how to implement LZ77
- Learning more about file handling
